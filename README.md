Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect whether a given news article is real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. 
The goal is to combat the spread of misinformation online by classifying news content based on linguistic patterns and context.
The project was developed as part of the YBI Foundation Internship Program, focusing on practical applications of data science in social and media analytics.
